Neil:
Sands of Time: Player encounters a time anomaly/rift which allows them to go back to encounter 1 with their current health state and items if they wish to

Berserker- Crazed wildman who attacks anything near him with reckless abandon. Very high damage, but very low AC

Rock Golem- Does very low damage but has very high AC. Maybe gets a surprise round because hes disguised as a rock?

Fight encounter- The player runs into two gentleman having a particularly brutal fight. The player may choose to help one or the other to receive +1 to hit or +some amount of HP.

Demon’s bribe- The player gets an offer to increase their +4 to hit in exchange for half their total health pool from a malicous looking ritualist.

Angelic blessing- A holy altar along the road reveals a blessing which gives the user a 5 hp shield (can be placed on top of max hp, but can’t be refilled once destroyed).
